I'm Jay, a student at Georgetown University studying **Computer Science, Ethics and Society**. I'm passionate for using data to unveil hidden insights, and informing decision making through such findings. In the past, I've worked with **WMATA — the 2nd largest metro transit authority in the US** — and Chaia Tacos — a local vegan taco restaurant in DC — in areas such as **supply chain predictive modeling, embeddings, and topic modeling**. 

I'm also fascinated by how emerging technologies interact with policy and society. Some of my articles can be found [here](https://thehoya.com/staff_name/jay-liu/). 

Some relevant coursework that I've taken in the past: 

- Computer Science I & II 

- Data Structures 

- Mathematical Methods for Computer Science 

- Probability and Statistics 

- Digital Law and Policy

- Tech, Ethics, and Society

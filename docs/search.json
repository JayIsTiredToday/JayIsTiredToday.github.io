I’m passionate for using data to unveil hidden insights, and informing decision making through such findings. In the past, I’ve worked with WMATA — the 2nd largest metro transit authority in the US — and Chaia Tacos — a local vegan taco restaurant in DC — in areas such as time series analyses, embeddings, and topic modeling.\nI’m also fascinated by how emerging technologies interact with law and policy. Some of my articles can be found here."

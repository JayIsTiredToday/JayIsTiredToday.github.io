In the past, I’ve worked with WMATA — the 2nd largest metro transit authority in the US — and Chaia Tacos — a local vegan taco restaurant in DC — in areas such as time series analyses, embeddings, and topic modeling.\nI’m also fascinated by how emerging technologies interact with law and policy.

In fact, there proved to be more traffic accidents involving bikes occuring along the bike lanes as shown below.\n\n(red: accidents involving injuries; green: accidents without injuries; gray: bike lanes. )\nFocusing solely on the bike lanes themselves, there isn’t evidence to show that bike lanes promote safety for riders. In fact, along the bike lanes there exists a higher percentage of red data points compared to green data points, meaning that the existence of bike lanes is seemingly linked to a higher frequency of injury-causing accidents.\nThis directly contradicts what I initially hypothesized and what intuition would tell us. However, upon closer inspection the finding actually makes sense due to sampling bias and reporting bias. Bike lanes attract more bikers, therefore leading to a higher number of raw accidents."
